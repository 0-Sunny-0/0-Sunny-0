- 👋 Hi, I’m @0-Sunny-0
- 👀 I’m interested in all things cute and colorful. Being able to bring a project to life and make it pretty is my m.o.
- 🌱 I’m currently learning Fullstack Web Development. Specifically HTML, CSS, and Javascript. Possibly interested in learning other programming languages once I've gotten my feet wet with these. 
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on various projects that will increase my knowledge and expertise. If you think I'd be a good addition to your project, please feel free to reach out.
- 📫 How to reach me: Email is always a safe bet msafinch@gmail.com.
- 😄 Pronouns: She/Her
